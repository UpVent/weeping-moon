> Name based on "Under the Weeping Moon" a song of the Orchid album.

Weeping Moon is an orchid-like bash script. Originally a sold module of Orchid
named "Strange Brew" aimed to help new server admins to harden their 
Ubuntu / Debian server installations. It aims to provide a quick and easy 
solution for common security problems on Ubuntu Servers.

## Project Status

Consider this as a pre-alpha. Things are tested but not that much so please be
careful and always try to test this in a controlled environment before
proceeding to real servers.

If you can wait please do so until the first release is out in the wild. Releases
are indeed tested in both Debian and Ubuntu (Stable & Latest LTS respectively)
